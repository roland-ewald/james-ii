Provides a flexible graph component to visualize graphs.

<p>
Many modeling formalisms are intrinsically graph based, e.g., state charts, petri nets, or system dynamics, or they
can be easily visualized, and or edited using a graph based view.
For some models a graph based run time visualization might be of interest, and control flows (workflows)
might be visualized using graphs as well.<br/>
Consequently this component is relatively flexible, but not a full grown graph package. Thus you
should consider to use any of the available full grown, specialized graph visualization packages if you
have to visualize large graphs, or if you are in need of up to date layout managers.

<p>
In accordance to other visual components data to be displayed is hold in a special model.
