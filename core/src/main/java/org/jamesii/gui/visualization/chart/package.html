Provides a flexible chart component to visualize simulation trajectories.

<p>
On executing simulations often the need arise to visualize the development of some parameters while 
the simulation is running.<br/>
This component is not intended to be a full replacement for any other chart component, or application 
which could be used to draw charts, but it is intended to be a good choice to visualize simulation runs
online without the need of any extra package.
</p>

<p>
The chart component provides support for
<ul>
	<li>line charts</li>
	<li>multiple axis scales</li>
</ul>
</p>
