Provides implements model reading. 

<h2>General description</h2>

In principal the framework always allows to have implemented models: we have executable model classes
from which a modeler can inherit his / her own model classes.
This package provides the support for "reading" these models to use them from within the usual
simulation workflow.
The model to be read should provide a constructor with a single parameter of type <code>HashMap</code>
mapping names to values. This parameter map is used by the framework to pass any user/experiment 
defined parameters to a model.
