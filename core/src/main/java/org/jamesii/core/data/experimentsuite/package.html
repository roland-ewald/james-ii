Provides the means to read and write experiment suite definitions. 

<h2>General description</h2>

Experiments are at the "heart" of a modeling and simulation framework, because they are essential
during the modeling process, and later on for the production runs.
The reproducibility of experiments is of extremely high importance for gaining "good" and valid
simulation results, and thus the documentation of experiments is mandatory.
<br>
Besides the handling of single experiments the framework supports collections of experiments.
Such a suite of experiments can be useful if a number of experiments shall be repeated, e.g., 
whenever something has been changed in one of the algorithms or one of the models, and so on.
<br>
Experiment suites, as experiments, are not restricted to any data sink / source and language.
It is relatively easy to add additional sources / targets from / to which suites are read / written.
