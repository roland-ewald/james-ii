 * The Interface IReadRunDataStorage. Read methods for a fixed simulation run in

 * Explanation of some commonly used variables:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>dataid</td>
 * <td>Identifies a simulation object, e.g., an agent, a molecule, ...</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>attribute</td>
 * <td>Each object identified by a dataId can have several attributes, e.g., an
 * agent could have various state variables (amount of money, education, ...), a
 * molecule could have a position and a movement vector</td>
 * </tr>
