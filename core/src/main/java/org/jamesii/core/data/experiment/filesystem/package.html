Provides the means to read experiment definitions from and to write experiment definitions to the file 
system. 

<h2>General description</h2>

By default the framework supports to store an experiment definition by using the bean to xml
serialization. However, this is just a simple default and may make it difficult to read old
experiment definitions in a couple of years (if the experiment class has been substantially changed).
In addition it makes it hard to exchange experiment definitions between different M&S software products.
Consequently this is a nice and simple fallback.
