Provides data collection basics for a support of resilience. 

<p>
With the framework a single simulation run can be executed in a distributed manner, and multiple runs can be executed in parallel.
Whenever this happens we are faced with the problem that single computing instances might fail, and that we need to be
able to recover from this. In this package the basic definition of a data base interface for resilience is given. This
can be used from all resilience tools to store snaphots and to recreate simulation runs from these.
