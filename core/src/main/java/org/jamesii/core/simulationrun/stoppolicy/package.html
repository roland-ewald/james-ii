Provides "simulation stop policies".

<h2>Package use</h2>

If a simulation is started it typically runs until no more progress can be made (e.g., in a discrete event
based simulation until no more upcoming events are available) or until a stop condition holds.
A simple stop condition typically used in M&S is the simulation stop time, thus the simulation run shall
proceed until a pre-defined simulation time value has been reached. Although this simple stop condition is 
used frequently it might not be sufficient for all cases. For example, you might be interested in a 
simulation run which runs until the trajectory has reached a certain quality criteria, and you don't know
the simulation time in advance where this is true. Or you might be interested in running the simulation
for a fixed amount of wall clock time to see how many single computation steps you had been able to do.
Or you have a different idea what should determine you simulation end.
