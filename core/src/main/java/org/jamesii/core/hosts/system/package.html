Provides the basics for hosts in the m&s framework. 

<p>
In the context of distributed modeling and simulation many jobs can be identified which
can be made available on a service base, some of those might require the notion of being a host.
These are typically those providing a very resource consuming service, e.g., simulation computation servers 
or database servers. <br>
The classes in here specialize the {@link james.core.hosts.IHost} by adding some m&s system specific methods.
Typically implementations of these interfaces are simulation computations servers, the master server, and so on.
It is more unlikely that someone will base a "simple" data base server on these interfaces - here the IHost 
interface should be the right thing to implement.
