Provides variable modification mechanisms.

<p>
Besides the replication of simulation runs out of diverse reasons it is often of interest to be able to
execute a large number of different simulation runs with different model parameters. These parameter
combinations could be defined by using sets / lists or whatever, or you could try to specify them using
"rules". This package provides the means to define how to modify the parameters of the model for the
next simulation run.
<br>
An example therefore is the {@link james.core.experiments.variables.modifier.IncrementModifierInteger} 
which can be setup to increment an Integer based variable from a given start value, using a given step
size up to a given end value.
Another example is the {@link james.core.experiments.variables.modifier.SequenceModifier} which gets
the next variable state from a list of states (one after the other).
