Provides the basics for observation issues. 


<p>
Observation is a key feature for modeling and simulation. It is essential to be able to record 
simulation trajectories, and often it is mandatory to instantly update visualizations.
In addition several advanced techniques (as load-balancing) require information to be collected
from a running simulation as well.
</p>

<p>
Basically observation in this framework is based on the observer pattern. But in addition we
make use of the mediator concept to be able to integrate any caching or filtering mechanism after
an observer has been activated.<br>
Observers are attached to observable entities by the process of instrumentation, by so called Instrumenters.
</p>

<p>
There are several special types of observers which are recognized by some methods in the framework,
and if found treated in a special manner, e.g., if a {@link james.core.observe.IStoringObserver} is found the framework
will automatically set the data sink to be used (if one has been specified).
