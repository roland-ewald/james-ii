Provides symbolic model support. 

<p>
Symbolic cannot be directly executed, however, there might be the chance to interpret them.
In contrast to an executable model a symbolic model does not need to be complete - it is the
data structure to hold the "source code" of the model which someone can try to translate / compile
into an executable model.
<br/>
This package provides the basic interface on which on general symbolic model algorithms should work,
as well as a default implementation of the interface from you can inherit your own symbolic model
realization, if you like to.
