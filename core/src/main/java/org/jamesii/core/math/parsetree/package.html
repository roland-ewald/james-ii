The parse tree / calculation tree package.

<h2>General description</h2>

Many modeling formalisms / languages allow to define mathematical
expressions. Therefore the framework ships with a default implementation of a
parse / calculation / arithmetic tree which supports many of the basic
arithmetic operations as well as some operations on lists.

This parse tree is based on the idea of a recursive tree definition, each node is 
constructed by using one or more children (nodes), besides the leafs which are nodes
containing constant values or "variables" (see {@link james.core.math.parsetree.variables.Environment}).
