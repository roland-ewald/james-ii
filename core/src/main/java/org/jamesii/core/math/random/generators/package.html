The pseudo random number generators package.

<h2>General description</h2>

In modelling and simulation you often need random numbers distributed according 
to different distributions. Pseudo random number generators typically produce 
equally distributed series of numbers which can be modified, so that different
distributions can be produced.<br/>
This package contains the extension point for pseudo random number generators
as well as a set of implementations of different generators.<br/>
Each number generator can be annotated by using the RNGInfo class with essential 
information like the length of the period of the generator.

<p>
Principally any number of pseudo random number generators can be added to the 
framework. However, due to the fact that checking the quality of random number
generators is a very complex process, and that many models and simulation 
algorithms heavily depend on "good" random numbers such generators should be 
developed with great care.
