Provides the direct (1:1) proxy - ref remote communication schema.

<p>
The framework does not make any restrictions on how remote communication is established.
Nevertheless the framework provides different schemas to do so.
The first schema is the proxy - ref schema which allows to decouple model implementations 
and remote communication issues. 
In addition this schema allows to use different remote communication methods as "backbone".
So it is possible to create instances of this schema based on Java RMI (shipping with the 
framework) or any other remote communication methodology (e.g., MPI, JavaMPI). 
</p>

<p>
Basically you have to implement a proxy class per model/simulation algorithm interface 
if you want to use this schema. These proxy classes are then to be integrated instead
of the remote sitting instances which they will represent on the local site.
These proxy classes have to contain a reference to the remote class, and they just act
as forwarder of method calls to the remote instances.
The ref instances on the remote site contain a link to the actual remote instance, the 
proxy linking them is representing. Any message call forwarded by a proxy to the ref will
be forwarded by the ref to the local instance.
Consequently proxy and ref have to deal with all remote communication issues, but the 
model/simulation algorithm classes do not have to be aware of the location of the objects
they are referring to.
</p>

<p>
This schema is a heavy burden if load - balancing shall be used.
If objects are moved around all corresponding proxy - ref connections have to be updated.
This might be a very expensive process.
Btw. this has nothing to do with "agent mobility" as this is, from the point of view of the
framework, a modelled mobility, but not a native mobility in regards to remote locations of
model parts.
