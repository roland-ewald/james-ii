Provides the basics for a distributed model by means of Java RMI. 


<p>
The framework is not restricted to any remote communication schema. This is at least true
for the creation of distributed models and simulation algorithms. However, the basic
implementation, the one shipping with this core, is based on Java RMI.
So there are no dependencies to anything outside of Java which are not handled by all JVM 
implementations.
