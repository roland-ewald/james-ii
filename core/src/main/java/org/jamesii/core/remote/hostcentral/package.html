Provides a centralized remote communication schema.

<p>
The framework does not make any restrictions on how remote communication is established.
Nevertheless the framework provides different schemas to do so.
One of the usable schemas is a per host centralized approach.
All accesses on remote objects are tunneled through a single entity.
Although this might be a bottle neck (whereby this strongly depends on how the class is created),
this schema eases migration of objects for load-balancing: only one object per involved host
has to be updated. This is, e.g., different if the direct remote communication schema is used.
