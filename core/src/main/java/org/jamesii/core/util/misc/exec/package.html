Provides means to execute external applications. 

<p>
Sometimes you might need to execute an external application. 
This can be done by using the class java.lang.ProcessBuilder, however you might need to execute the external
application in an extra thread in the current virtual machine, so that the execution cannot block your own
application.
That's what the class {@link james.core.util.misc.exec.ApplicationExecutionThread} has been designed for.
In addition the output streams of an application might be of interest, 
or there might just be the need to empty these,
so that the application can be executed without problems: the class {@link james.core.util.misc.exec.StreamReader} 
can do this for you. It is used by {@link james.core.util.misc.exec.ApplicationExecutionThread} by default.
</p>
Our recommendation is that you use the {@link james.core.util.misc.exec.ApplicationExecutionThread} instead
of the ProcessBuilder wherever possible.
