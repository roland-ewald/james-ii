Provides event queue / calendar queue / event set / priority queue data structure plug-ins and extension point therefore.

<p>
For discrete event based simulation algorithms the usage of an event queuing mechanism is most often mandatory.
It is the data structure usually used most often - for each step an event has to be dequeued, and afterwards usually at 
least one event is enqueued again.
Thus there are in the mean at least two operations on this data structure.
Thereby these data structures may contain thousands, or even millions of entries.
This makes the usage of optimized data structures mandatory if one is interested in an efficient simulation.
Due to efficiency reasons event queues are <b>not synchronized</b> by default. 
If you need a synchronized event queue you should consider writing a wrapper, however, you should really try to avoid this.
<br/>
Many implementations of event queues only provide a very simple interface comprising two methods:
<ul>
	<li>enqueue</li> - add an element to the queue
	<li>dequeue</li> - fetch the element with the smallest time stamp
</ul> 
In the framework we use an extended interface definition, basically the interface is extended by two additional methods:
<ul>
	<li>dequeueAll</li> - fetch all elements with the smallest time stamp (and not just one of those)
	<li>requeue</li> - update the time stamp of an event already in the queue
</ul>
</p>
