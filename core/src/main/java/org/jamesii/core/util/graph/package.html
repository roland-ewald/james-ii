<p>
Graph classes are needed for different purposes in the realm of modelling and simulation.
<ul>
	<li>graph based modeling formalisms can be based upon more abstract graph classes</li>
	<li>searching graphs may be needed in models (e.g., network models)</li>
	<li>partitioning, and load-balancing are typically based on graphs as well</li> 
</ul>
