Provides support for benchmarks. 

<p>
Any experimental algorithmics should be based on standardized benchmarks - otherwise the results achieved
cannot be compared cross computing hardware. Due to the influence of characteristics of different 
hardware experimental results without accompanying benchmark results should not be published at all.<br/>
Only benchmark results available for all computing hardware involved allows to justify about the performance
of algorithms and potential speedups. Therefore this M&S framework provides an extra extension point for
the integration of automated benchmark computation. The framework itself is shipping with a simple
benchmark (see <b>simple</b> subpackage). However, depending on the hardware used and the algorithms to be
examined you will most likely be in need of more sophisticated benchmarking solutions. Check the available
plug-ins which are of interest for you, and if none matches just add your own one.
