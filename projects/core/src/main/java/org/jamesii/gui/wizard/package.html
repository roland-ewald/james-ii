Provides a flexible wizard component to create wizard based workflows.

<p>
Many predefined workflows can be mapped onto "wizard" components: one step has to be done after
a preceding one has been finished. Basically all wizards look like each other - they consist of 
a page with arbitrary content and a set of buttons at the bottom of the dialog (typically back, 
next, finish, and cancel whereby not all of them have to be always enabled).
