Provides a flexible framework for the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

<p>
In general the m&s framework provides means which make it easier to create 
specialized tools. The same holds true for the GUI framework provided here.
However, you are by no way forced to base your application's graphical user
interface on anything in here - but you can, and this can make your life a 
lot easier, depending on what you wanna do.
</p>

<p>
The default GUI (out of the box GUI) provides support for perspectives which add
categories of functionality to the GUI (e.g., modelling), and for the management
of plug-ins, distributed simulations, as well as the ability to get extended by
model and experiment editors.
