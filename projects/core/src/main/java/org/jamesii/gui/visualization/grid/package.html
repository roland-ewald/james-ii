Provides a flexible grid component to visualize grids.

<p>
Some formalisms, e.g., cellular automata are grid based formalisms, and thus, if they shall be visualized,
a grid visualization is required. In addition grids are often used as an abstraction level for geographical
data, and thus run time visualizations with per grid cell information are in need of such a visualization
as well.
<br/>
Besides visualization this grid implementation can be used to edit grids as well, e.g., to set initial states. 
</p>

<p>
The grid component provides support for
<ul>
	<li>1-D grids</li>
	<li>2-D grids</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In accordance to other visual components data to be displayed is hold in a special model.
