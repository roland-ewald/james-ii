/**
 * The Interface IWriteDataStorageSingleComputation. Write methods for a fixed
 * computation task in a fixed experiment. This means experiment and run have to
 * be pre-selected (known by the implementing class)! <br>
 * The data schema available through this interface is very general, but it has
 * to be usable for any m&s paradigm including distributed simulation
 * executions. Due to the generality you need to find your own mapping of your
 * trajectory data to this interface. But therefore you get the possibility to
 * use any data sink implementing this interface. By this interface it is not
 * defined how the data is written into the actual data sink - this is
 * completely left over to the implementation.
 * 
 * Explanation of some commonly used variables:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>dataid</td>
 * <td>Identifies a simulation object, e.g., an agent, a molecule, ...</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>attribute</td>
 * <td>Each object identified by a dataId can have several attributes, e.g., an
 * agent could have various state variables (amount of money, education, ...), a
 * molecule could have a position and a movement vector</td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * </table>

  /**
   * Write data. Write the data value of the attribute of the object identified
   * by the dataId for the timestamp given.
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * The dataID can be used to identify simulation objects, like individuals,
   * species or whatever remains in a simulation for a period of time and of
   * which you'd like to record data. Basically you could then ignore the
   * attribute and just store the corresponding java object by using this
   * method. However, this may hamper the post processing. Because of this data
   * sinks may provide internally better means to treat the basic data types,
   * and thus you should use the attribute's to separately store the single
   * attribute values of a simulation object.<br/>
   * You are not fixed to this interpretation of dataID and attrib at all. You
   * can just map your data schema to these variables. E.g., you could even
   * store hierarchies, dependencies, etc by exploiting the attrib. For example,
   * you could use an attrib "path" which then gets as value s.th. like dataId +
   * "." + dataID + "." ...
