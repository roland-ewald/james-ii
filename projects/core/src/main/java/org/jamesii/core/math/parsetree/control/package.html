The parse tree / calculation tree package - condition package.

<h2>General description</h2>

Many modeling formalisms / languages allow to define mathematical
expressions. Therefore the framework ships with a default implementation of a
parse / calculation / arithmetic tree which supports many of the basic
arithmetic operations as well as some operations on lists.

<p>
The control package provides nodes representing control statements, like if-then-else or case statements.
