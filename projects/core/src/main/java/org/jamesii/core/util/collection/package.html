Provides different collection implementations, and utility functions and methods for these. 

<p>
Very often data structures are needed which provide a mapping with a fast access, or lean

many different implementations of such structures - but sometimes you might need something 
slightly different as provided by Java. This package contains several different sets, maps, 
and lists as those shipping with Java.
