Provides the means to read and write experiment definitions. 

<h2>General description</h2>

Experiments are at the "heart" of a modeling and simulation framework, because they are essential
during the modeling process, and later on for the production runs.
The reproducibility of experiments is of extremely high importance for gaining "good" and valid
simulation results, and thus the documentation of experiments is mandatory.
I.e., the descriptions of experiments should be stored in a precise manner. The framework thereby 
does not make any restrictions in regards to the format / language to be used therefore.
There might be any number of experiment readers and writers usable here, and thus experiments
can in principal be stored in any language, and written and retrieved from any storing device.
