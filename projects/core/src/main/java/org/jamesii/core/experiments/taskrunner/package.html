Provides the basics for "task runners". 

<p>
"Task runners" are used in the framework to execute 
"tasks" / "jobs" / "simulation configurations" / "parameter configurations" scheduled by an instance of 
{@link james.core.experiments.BaseExperiment}. For the latter it is of no
interest how a runner executes the jobs. This allows to have quite different
runners which can execute the jobs in a sequential manner on a single local host,
in a coarse- or fine-grained manner on a single multi-core/multi-CPU local host, or
by making use of the distributed simulation facilities of the framework.<br/>

If you are "just using" the framework you'll typically not get in touch with the runners
at all - you'll remain on the level of the experiment, where you select how to execute the
simulation runs - everything else is done by the framework on its own.<br/>

If you identify the need to create your own runner this can be "easily" done as well:
simulation runners are an extension point as well, and thus any additional task runner
can be added as a plug-in. There you have to create a class implementing the {link ISimulationRunner}
interface, and to setup the plug-in according to the plug-in type for simulation runners.
