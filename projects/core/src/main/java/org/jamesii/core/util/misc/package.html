Provides miscellaneous classes and methods.

<p>
Many small helper functions are often needed and very often they are realized as 
private members of the classes they are needed in. Java already defines many helper
methods in its String, Integer, Double, ... classes. Among those the diverse conversion
methods. However, it often turns out that the method you are looking for is not included.
These are methods collected in this package.
