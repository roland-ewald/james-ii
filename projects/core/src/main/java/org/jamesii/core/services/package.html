Provides the basics for services in the m&s framework. 

<p>
In the context of distributed modeling and simulation many jobs can be identified which
can be made available on a service base. This package provides the basics for a service
view on these "services" in the context of this m%s framework.
Anything can be realized as a service, however, there is functionality where the service
notion does not match as perfect as for others. So for example an event queue 
implementation is performance critical part of a simulation algorithm and there should
not be any chance to place it on a remote host. However, there is on the other side a
lot of functionality which can be provided as a service, the most dominant one being the
service of executing simulation runs.
The {@link james.core.services.ServiceRegistry} can be used to manage a set of services as well as their 
usage. This management is based on the design contract that services get only registered
at <b>one</b> service registry. 
</p>

<p>
Besides the basics of service definition and management this package provides the means to mark methods
of a service as being of interest to a user. This can be done by using the {@link james.core.services.TriggerableByName}
interface. In the default GUI of the framework these methods can then be executed by any user.
