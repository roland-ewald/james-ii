Math package for the simulation framework.

<h2>General description</h2>

The math packages provide various mathematical functions more
or less frequently required for modeling and simulation. They have been
implemented and ship with the core to reduce the need of integrating
external packages, and thus to reduce dependencies of projects based on
the framework. Some of them are even required in the core, and the core has
by convention, no dependencies to any external stuff.
<br>
However, if you prefer to use an external math package for your M&S application
this is possible as well - then you can ignore this package.
<br>
Basically this package and its subpackages contain math stuff from as different domains as
<ul>
  <li>parse trees</li>
  <li>random numbers / random distributions</li>
  <li>statistics</li>
  <li>complex numbers</li>
  <li>integration algorithms</li>
  <li>interpolation</li>
  <li>matrix handling</li>
</ul>
The random numbers for example are used throughout the framework and they are the only part which
should not completely exchanged: a sophisticated handling of random number generation is mandatory
for credible simulation results. If you are in need of different random number generators / different
implementations of generators provided by the framework you should add these by using the corresponding
plug-in type of the framework.
