Provides simulation run, and simulation server management for parallel and parallel distributed simulation runs.

<p>
In terms of the framework a simulation run {@link james.core.simulation.ISimulationRun} is the attempt to compute a trajectory of a 
model with a set of given parameters. Such parameter configurations are typically generated by an experiment
definition {@link james.core.experiments.BaseExperiment}. The simulation run as such is created on the host 
it shall be executed on, for the run time of the job. Thus a simulation run is not a persistent object available
anywhere in the framework.
<br/>
In the sub packages of this package additional functionality for the execution of distributed simulations has been
realized on base of the "service" notion in the framework. Among those, 
{@link james.core.simulation.distributed.masterserver.IMasterServer} and 
{@link james.core.simulation.distributed.simulationserver.ISimulationServer}, partitioning algorithms, and 
load balancing algorithms extension points.
<br/>
Another important aspect for the execution of simulation runs is resilience, thus the ability to recover from
resources which turns to be unavailable during execution.
