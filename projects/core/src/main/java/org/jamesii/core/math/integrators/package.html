Provides numerical integration stuff. 

<h2>Continuous and hybrid simulation</h2>

Continuous simulation is used commonly in many scientific and industrial applications.
Hybrid simulations combine continuous and discrete models, so that features of both 
modeling paradigms can be used.
The base for continuous models are differential equations, the algorithms to solve these
are called "integration" algorithms.
Many different simulation algorithms have been developed so far, among those the 
well-known Euler and Runge-Kutta algorithms.
The list of integration algorithms developed so far is already pretty long, and 
consequently integration algorithms can be added to the framework via an extension point.

Herein the basic for all this is realized. 
Basic interfaces to describe equations as well as interfaces for numerical integration
algorithms are contained.
