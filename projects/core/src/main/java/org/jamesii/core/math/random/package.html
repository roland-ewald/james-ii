The random number package.

<h2>General description</h2>

Many modelling formalisms and simulation algorithms depend on stochasticity, 
and thus on pseudo random number generation.
This packages contains the basic interfaces for random number in the modelling 
and simulation framework. In modelling and simulation the full control over
"random" processes is mandatory: the repeatability of experiments has to be
guaranteed.
<br/>
The sub package <tt>generators</tt> contains the extension point for pseudo random 
number generators.
<br/>
The sub package <tt>seedgenerators</tt> contains the extension point for seed 
generators for initializing pseudo random number generators.
<br/>
The sub package <tt>distributions</tt> contains implementations of distributions
which are fed by one of the random number generators.
The random number generators typically produce equally distributed random numbers,
however we often need random number distributed according to a certain distribution,
e.g., exponentially distributed numbers.
<br/>
The <tt>RandomSampler</br> class finally provides methods for sampling random sets.
