Provides the basics for equally distributed, and thus as efficient as possible, simulation runs: the load - balancing or re-partitioning. 

<p>
With the framework a single simulation run can be executed in a distributed manner. The key issue therefore is to
find a good initial partitioning, i.e., a mapping between parts of the model and the available computing infrastructure.
However, the model characteristics which determined the initial partitioning might change drastically during the 
computation of a simulation run. Load-balancing (aka dynamic re - partitioning) tries to detect such changes and
to resolve any unbalances arising out of this.
