Provides different remote communications schemas.

<p>
Remote communication is an important issue for efficient parallel and distributed simulation runs.
In principal remote communication can be established using a variety of different basic concepts,
e.g., a direct, bi - directional pattern directly coupling two objects which have references to each
other but residing in different JVMs or a centralized pattern which makes some things easier to realize,
but which might imply a bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
Which pattern is used should be open, however, all patterns have to support a minimal set
of functionality:
<ul>
	<li>
	Communication: Remote communication should be possible - thus method calls have to be forwarded
	in a reliable manner.
	</li>
	<li>
	Types of objects: The patterns have to work for models as well as for simulation algorithms.
	However, the functionality required for models might be heavily restricted, depending on which
	model methods should be executable from remote.
	</li>
	<li>Object migration: During load balancing there might be the need to move objects to another 
	host: and thus we might need to update references to these objects, or to provide other concepts
	to overcome the issue of relocated object.</li>
</ul>
