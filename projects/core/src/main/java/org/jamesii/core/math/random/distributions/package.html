The random number distributions package.

<h2>General description</h2>

In modelling and simulation you often need random numbers distributed according 
to different distributions. Pseudo random number generators typically produce 
equally distributed series of numbers which can be modified, so that different
distributions can be produced.<br/>
This package contains different random distributions, all added as plug-ins to
the framework.<br/>
Each distribution has to be fed by a pseudo random number generator, which allow
the combination of any available random number generator with their 
implementations.
