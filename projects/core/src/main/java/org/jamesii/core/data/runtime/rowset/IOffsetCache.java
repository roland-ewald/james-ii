 * any way desired. Caches should be capped at a certain size and a particular
 * implementation can involve a certain strategy as to what entries are kept and
 * what get culled once the cache gets too large (e.g.
 * <em>most-recently used</em>, <em>most-frequently used</em>, etc.).
 * <p>
 * A cache must offer fast access to its entries (otherwise there is no
 * particular benefit to using a cache).
