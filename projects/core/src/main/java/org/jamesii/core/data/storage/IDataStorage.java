/**
 * General data storage interface. All data storage types must implement this
 * interface.
 * 
 * Commonly used variables
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td>expId</td>
 * <td>You can use a data storage to store results from any number of
 * simulations, each one has an own id. Is computed using the
 * {@link #setExperimentID(IUniqueID)} method.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>confId</td>
 * <td>You can use a data storage to store results from any number of
 * configurations, each one has an own id. Is computed using the
 * {@link #setConfigurationID(IUniqueID, IUniqueID)} method.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>compTaskId</td>
 * <td>Per experiment you can have any number of computation tasks, each one has
 * an own id. Is computed using the
 * {@link #setComputationTaskID(IUniqueID, IUniqueID, IUniqueID)} method.</td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * </table>
 * 
 * The type of the InternalID to be passed here is used throughout the data
 * storage to identify experiments, configurations, and computation runs in the
 * data storage. Further on it used in many methods to identify what to read /
 * where to write to. Background: It is assumed (and guaranteed by the
 * corresponding classes of the framework) that each experiment, configuration,
 * and replication has a unique ID. This unique ID has to be used in
 * implementations of this interface to compute the corresponding internal ids.
 * Internal ids for configurations and computation tasks do not need to be
 * unique over all experiments, i.e., they might range per experiment /
 * configuration from 0 or 1 up to the number of configurations / computations
 * per configuration. However, in principal it would be ok as well to simply
 * return the unique id in implementations of the setters specified in here. The
 * internal ids had been introduced to provide a leaner access, thus to avoid
 * that a data storage has always to deal with the rather complex unique ids per
 * write / read operation.
