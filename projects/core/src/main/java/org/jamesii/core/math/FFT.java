 * This class performs a Fast Fourier Transform on an array of complex input
 * values. This class is adapted from Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms in Java.
 * According to his own comments about it it is very basic and not very fast
 * (although that lies partly with the implementation of {@link Complex}. If we
 * experience performance issues, this class might be replaced, however, this
 * should be of minimal concern as of now.
 * <p>
 * The FFT can only be fast (and thus is only defined) for array lengths of
 * powers of two.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Finish ComplexArray1D and adapt this class to use it.
