The "special rng" package.

<h2>General description</h2>

Often in M&S random number generators are used as they are. I.e., a random number generator
provided by the system used is embedded into the simultion run execution and that's it.
However, there are some constraints which one might want to take into account, e.g., that
you should not exploit a random numbers period, that you might want to skip the first N
numbers produced, and so on.<br>
Therefore we created "special" random number generators which are in fact just wrappers 
around the "normal" random number generators available. I.e., you can wrap any of the 
random number generators available by a "chain" of the special random number generators
or by your own "special" rng. Btw - the "special" rngs are just handled by the framework
as if they are "normal" rngs.
