Provides application wide logging.

<p>
Experiments might take a long time, and users might not want to wait in front of their machine to get all messages 
directly. In a remote setup a forwarding mechanism for these messages is mandatory as well.
This package provides a centralized application wide logger which can be used from anywhere in the System.
Most often the logger is used through the <code>report</code> methods of {@link james.SimSystem}, respectively
the corresponding convenience methods defined in Entity.
<br>
Nevertheless you can use the {@link james.core.util.logging.ApplicationLogger} directly as well. This class is
realized as a singleton, thus all "easy" access methods are static.
<br>
Reporting log messages to any target can be done by using the {@link james.core.util.logging.ILogListener} interface.
The remote sub package allows the forwarding of log messages to remote machines.
