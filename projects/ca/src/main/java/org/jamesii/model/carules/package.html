Provides "rule based" cellular automatons.

<h2>General description</h2>

This package provides cellular automatons of which the transition functions have to be realized
on a "rules" base. Currently the rules are restricted to be "counting" rules, thus they will 
switch the state if the count of neighbors is as expected - but you can't add a propability therefore.
Thus you will not be able to org.jamesii.model the typical gossip org.jamesii.model with a rate to forget something.
