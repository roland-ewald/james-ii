Provides the basics for *DEVS (executable) model classes. 

<h2>General description</h2>

DEVS is meanwhile a relatively old modeling formalism. 
As often many extensions of the basic formalism exist. 
Basically most DEVS variants differentiate between coupled/network and atomic models.
Most DEVS models have sets of input and output ports, most network models a set of 
models and several sets of couplings.
These basic elements can be reused throughout many implementations, and thus it is useful
to have these in an extra package so that they can be reused from several standalone 
packages later on.<br>
All data structure used by PDEVS models (for port, coupling, and model sets) are realized 
in sub packages of this package. For some of these alternatives might be good to have:
so the implementation giving the best performance in regards to memory consumption and 
run time behavior can be used. <br>
Consequently this package does not provide a usable formalism - if you want to use DEVS
for modeling you have to get a package (maybe based on this) providing supporting for the
*DEVS formalism you want to use.
